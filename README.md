# Monitoring Stack for Project

This repository contains Kubernetes manifests to deploy a full monitoring stack:

- **OpenTelemetry Collector**
- **Prometheus**
- **Grafana Loki**
- **Promtail**
- **Grafana**

The stack collects metrics and logs from your project and cluster nodes.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

Apply all manifests at once:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/ -R
The manifests/ folder contains:

otel-collector.yaml

prometheus.yaml

grafana.yaml

loki.yaml

promtail.yaml

Check that all pods are running:

kubectl get pods -n default

⚙️ Configure Grafana Datasources
Open Grafana UI:

kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000 -n default
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Add Data Sources:

Prometheus → http://prometheus:9090

Loki → http://loki:3100

In Grafana: Configuration → Data Sources → Add data source

📊 Import Demo Dashboard
Go to Dashboards → Manage → Import

Choose the file: dashboards/demo-logs-metrics.json

Set Datasource mapping:

PROMETHEUS_DS → Prometheus

LOKI_DS → Loki

Click Import

You will see a Dashboard with:

CPU and Memory metrics of your Pods

Logs from your project and cluster nodes

🖼️ Demo Dashboard Screenshot

Create the screenshot in Grafana after importing the dashboard and save as screenshots/demo-dashboard.png.

🔍 Explore Logs
Open Grafana → Explore → Loki and run a query:


{job="your-app"} |= ""
This shows all logs as strings, avoiding “Data is missing a string field” issues.

✅ Notes
Ensure Promtail is deployed and correctly collecting logs from all Pods and nodes.

Make sure the correct Data Sources are selected in Dashboard panels.

You can customize the dashboard to add additional metrics or log queries.
